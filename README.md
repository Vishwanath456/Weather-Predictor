# üå§Ô∏è Weather Predictor for Tomorrow

A simple Streamlit web app that predicts tomorrow's weather based on the past 3 days of weather data. The app uses machine learning models trained on synthetic data to forecast:
- Temperature (¬∞C)
- Humidity (%)
- Precipitation (%)
- Wind Speed (kph)
- Cloud Cover (Clear/Partly Cloudy/Cloudy)

## Demo

## Features
- User-friendly web interface
- Input weather data for the past 3 days
- Predicts next day's weather conditions
- Instant results with clear visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+

### Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App
Start the Streamlit app with:
```bash
streamlit run weather_predictor_app.py
```
This will open the app in your default web browser.

## Project Structure
- `weather_predictor_app.py` ‚Äî Main Streamlit application
- `weather_model.pkl`, `cloud_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `cloud_encoder.pkl` ‚Äî Pre-trained model and encoder files
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Python dependencies
- `README.md` ‚Äî Project documentation

## Notes
- The models are trained on synthetic data for demonstration purposes. For real-world use, retrain with actual weather data.
- If you want to retrain the models, you can use a script similar to the original `train_weather_model.py` (not included in this cleaned version).
